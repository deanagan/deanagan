### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning web development and the cloud. Typescript, asp.net, C# and Python are my jam.
You can access my blog [here](https://deanagan.github.io).

I also like doing presentations. Here's a [C++ presentation](https://deanagan.github.io/modern-cpp-stl-presentation/#/) I used Revealjs with a little bit of Vue to make it easier to manage. The project includes C++ source code unit tested with gtest and uses Bazel for the build. It is also setup with CI using travis.

I've also got a few codes and demos on my repository.
1. [C# Design Patterns](https://github.com/deanagan/csharp-design-patterns). This one's unit tested with xunit, some Moq and has travis-ci setup for awesomeness.
2. Test driven coding to some programming puzzles. I've got Github Actions setup on these.
