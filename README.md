### Hi there 👋

Some of the things I'm working on:
1. [C# Design Patterns](https://github.com/deanagan/csharp-design-patterns). Unit tested with xunit, some Moq and Github Actions and TravisCI setup.
2. [React Learning Playground](https://react-learning-dagan.netlify.app) This project is a hybrid slide and code sandbox for learning react.
3. [Modern C++ and STL](https://deanagan.github.io/modern-cpp-stl-presentation) This project is written in Vuejs(-ish) where I created a slide about C++.
4. [Seed Collection TailwindCSS](https://dreamy-figolla-56920d.netlify.app/) This project is dual purpose, 1 - try out react + tailwind, 2 - have a static site to store my card collection
5. Test driven coding solutions to some programming puzzles in my favorite programming languages. I've got Github Actions setup on these languages:<br/>

    [![Dart](/assets/images/dart.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-dart)
    [![Typescript](/assets/images/typescript.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-typescript)
    [![Python](/assets/images/python.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-python)
    [![Kotlin](/assets/images/kotlin.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-kotlin)
    [![C++](/assets/images/cpp.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-cpp)


These are tiny code pieces and are in no way a measure of my coding skills. I am forever curious about how other programming languages work, in the hopes of gaining some tips on how I could possibly improve my coding skills. Other than that, who doesn't love coding as a crossword puzzle replacement activity?
