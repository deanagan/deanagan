### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Some of the things I'm working on:
1. [C# Design Patterns](https://github.com/deanagan/csharp-design-patterns). This one's unit tested with xunit, some Moq and has travis-ci setup for awesomeness.
2. Test driven coding solutions to some programming puzzles in my favorite programming languages. I've got Github Actions setup on these languages:<br/>

    [![Python](/assets/images/python.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-python)

    [![C++](/assets/images/cpp.png)](https://github.com/deanagan/practice-cpp)

These are tiny code pieces and are in no way a measure of my coding skills (so no, I'm not a ninja/rockstar/unicorn. ðŸ˜„). Most activity (green blocks) come from code katas and language exploration on my free time. I am forever curious about how other programming languages work, in the hopes of gaining some tips on how I could possibly improve my coding skills. Other than that, who doesn't love coding as a crossword puzzle replacement activity?
