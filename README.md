### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning web development and the cloud. 
You can access my blog [here](https://deanagan.github.io).

My ongoing project is my [react app](http://deanagan.github.io/recipes) already deployed on my github pages. And my asp.net backend project called [readytogo](https://github.com/deanagan/ready-to-go-backend).

I also like doing presentations. Here's a [C++ presentation](https://deanagan.github.io/modern-cpp-stl-presentation/#/) I used Revealjs with a little bit of Vue to make it easier to manage. The project includes C++ source code unit tested with gtest and uses Bazel for the build. It is also setup with CI using travis.

I've also got a few code snippets and demos on my repository. 
1. [C# Design Patterns](https://github.com/deanagan/csharp-design-patterns). This one's unit tested with xunit, some Moq and has travis-ci setup for awesomeness.
2. Code Solutions to popular coding sites like LeetCode, Codewars, etc. I have them in my favourite programming languages.

Thanks for visiting and hope to collaborate with you in the future!
